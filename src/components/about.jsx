          I have completed my education at the university, specializing in
          "Electronic Security Systems." During my studies, I developed a keen
          interest in web programming and pursued courses in this field at the
          High-Tech Park. Later, I discovered the opportunity to become a
          trainer at ITGenio.
          <br /><br />I have been working at ITGenio for 3.5 years as a trainer in web
          development and Python. I am also responsible for the development of
          some courses at ITGenio and administer the website itgen.io.
          <br /><br />I am enthusiastic about advancing my skills in front-end
          development, collaborating in a team environment, and gaining new
          connections and experiences.
