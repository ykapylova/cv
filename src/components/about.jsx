        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <div className="text">
          I completed my education in "Electronic Security Systems" at
          university, where I developed a strong interest in web programming. To
          further pursue this passion, I took courses in web development at the
          High-Tech Park.
          <br />
          <br />
          Afterward, I started my career as a teacher at ITGenio programming
          school, where I worked for 4.5 years, teaching web development and
          Python.
          <br />
          <br />
          After gaining significant teaching experience, I transitioned into
          front-end development, working for a year as a developer in ITGenio.
          Currently, I am interning as a full-stack developer (Node.js) at an IT
          company. I'm passionate about expanding my skills, working in
          collaborative environments, and continuing to grow in the tech
          industry.
